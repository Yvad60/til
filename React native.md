#### `The difference between Expo and React native CLIs`
When working with a React native project you can either use React native CLI or Expo CLI
Expo is a set of tools built on the top of React native to help getting started with React native easily and faster while React native is a framework built on the top Of React to allow developing native mobile applications using a React js similar API

`React native CLI`: packed with more functionality and customisation but will require much configurations also requires Android studio and Xcode to start developping

`Expo CLI`: With expo you will still write React native code but gets you started very quickly with the expo go client app to test on a real device but provides limited features when it comes to customisation
