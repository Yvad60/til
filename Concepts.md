### `Extract Transform Load`

ETL is a process of combining data from different source and combine them into a single source. the data are `extracted` from different sources, `transformed` to have a desired format and `loaded` in desired location

`Example`: You can have a long file of Json object dataset that you would like to include in relational database.in this case you can parse the JSON object and extract desired data transofrm them into culumns to fit into relational database table and the transformed columns will be loaded to the desired database
