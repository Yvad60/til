Clean code is about communicating intent, Readability and meaningful abstraction 
- Communicating intent: Clean code should be able to explain what whoever who wrote was trying to achieve in a simpler way
- Readability: Clean code should be easier to read with good format and consistency
- Meaningful abstractions: clean code should hide complexity from the reader so that you can use a part of the code without worrying the internals details unless you are interested into them
